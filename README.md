# CEN-3031-Project

Intervids is an interactive web application aimed at increasing student interaction in remote classrooms due to the Covid-19 virus. This dynamic web application promotes active student interaction by giving students the ability to both leave comments and reply to other students' comments while watching their courses lectures. Intervids’ purpose serves to bridge the learning gap that in-person classrooms provide over remote classrooms. 

**Tools Used:** Intervids uses Karma - Jasmine,  HTML, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, for its frontend functionality. It also utilizes Node.js, Javascript, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage, and Firestore Database for its backend configuration. 

**Contribution Guidelines**
1. Always create a new branch when working on the project. Never work directly off of main.
2. Don’t push directly to main. First create a pull request to be reviewed by another developer.
3. After your branch has been merged to main, delete your old branch to keep the repository clean.
4. Make sure that your changes still pass all tests before creating a pull request.

7.  Navigate to the /Frontend directory 
8.  Build the application using this command: ng build 
9.  Run the server by using this command: ng serve
